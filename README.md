# IF-TODIM: An intuitionistic fuzzy TODIM

This repository contains the code for the paper [IF-TODIM: An intuitionistic fuzzy TODIM to multi-criteria decision making](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705113002645?casa_token=Sa1eFANCXDIAAAAA:OG4s6RB4hITksvChvGOfHeATFXWZIT8owvqgR0Y1zJhk_FzYK6eIhr8glST-qrDdeiuLidwXRYgX).

In addition, we also include the code to group decision and for TOPSIS (just in case you want to carry out some comparisons).

To run the study cases **Chain supply** and **Oil spill in the sea** you just need to run the scripts [IF_TODIM_chain.m](https://github.com/paaatcha/IF-TODIM/blob/master/IF_TODIM_chain.m) and [IF_TODIM_oil.m](https://github.com/paaatcha/IF-TODIM/blob/master/IF_TODIM_Group_Oil.m), respectively.
